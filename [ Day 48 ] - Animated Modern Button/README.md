# Sparkle Button CSS Project

This project is part of day 48 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This project showcases a dynamic, interactive button with a sparkle animation effect using pure CSS. The button is designed to provide an engaging user experience with responsive animations that react to user interactions such as hovering and clicking. This project is a great example of using advanced CSS techniques like custom properties, animations, and pseudo-elements to create visually appealing UI components without relying on JavaScript.
