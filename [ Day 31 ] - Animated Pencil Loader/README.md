## HTML Structure

The HTML file defines the structure of the loader. It includes a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration and sets the document type as HTML. The content is enclosed within `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Key elements include:

- **Character Encoding:** The document specifies UTF-8 character encoding for proper text rendering.
- **Viewport Configuration:** Meta tags are used to configure the viewport for responsive design.
- **External Stylesheet:** The HTML file links to an external CSS stylesheet named `style.css`.
- **Page Title:** The title of the webpage is set to "Animated Pencil Loader".
- **Loader Elements:** Various `<div>` elements are used to create the pencil loader, including subdivisions for the pencil's components and a horizontal line.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) contains styling rules to customize the appearance and animation of the loader. Key styling features include:

- **Font:** The Google Fonts library is imported to use the "Poppins" font family.
- **Layout:** Flexbox layout is utilized to center the content both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.
- **Background:** Gradient background colors are applied to the body element.
- **Pencil Animation:** Keyframes are defined to animate the rotation and movement of the pencil icon.
- **Pencil Components:** Styling rules are provided for each component of the pencil, including the ball point, cap, middle section, and eraser.
- **Line Animation:** Another set of keyframes is defined to animate the horizontal line below the pencil.
- **Typography:** Font size and positioning are adjusted for the loading message.
