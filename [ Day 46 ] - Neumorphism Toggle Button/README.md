# Neumorphism Toggle Button

This project is part of day 46 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This project showcases a stylish toggle button designed using the neumorphism design trend. Neumorphism, a portmanteau of "new" and "skeuomorphism," is characterized by subtle shadows and highlights that create a soft, extruded plastic look. The toggle button is created using HTML and CSS, emphasizing modern design aesthetics and smooth transitions.
