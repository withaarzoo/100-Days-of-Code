# Animated Dog CSS

This project is part of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge, specifically Day 28. It showcases an animated dog using CSS animations.

## Description

The code provided creates an animated dog using CSS. The dog's various body parts, such as the head, ears, legs, and tail, are animated to create a lifelike movement. The animation is achieved through the use of CSS variables, keyframes, and various positioning and transformation techniques.

## Features

- Animated dog with a moving head, ears, legs, and tail
- Smooth and fluid animations using CSS keyframes
- Customizable colors and animation durations through CSS variables
- Responsive design that scales the dog to fit the viewport

## Usage

To use this project, simply include the CSS code in your HTML file and add the necessary HTML structure for the dog. You can customize the colors and animation durations by modifying the CSS variables at the top of the file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Animated Dog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="🐕">
        <!-- Dog structure goes here -->
    </div>
</body>
