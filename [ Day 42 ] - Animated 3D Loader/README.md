# Animated 3D Loader

This project is part of day 42 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This project provides an animated 3D loader implemented in HTML and CSS. The loader consists of four boxes that move in a coordinated manner, creating a visually appealing loading animation. Each box has three sides with different colors, giving the illusion of a 3D effect as they rotate and animate.
