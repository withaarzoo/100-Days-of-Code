# Animated Rocket Loader

This project is part of Day 23 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This is a simple HTML and CSS code snippet that creates an animated rocket loader. It's a fun and visually appealing way to indicate that something is loading or processing in your web application. The rocket moves upward and emits smoke as it goes, giving the impression of a rocket taking off.
