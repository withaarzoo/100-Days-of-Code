## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to create an animated loading spinner using HTML and CSS. The spinner is made up of five circles that move in a synchronized manner, creating a continuous loading effect. The animation is achieved through CSS keyframes, which define the movement and fade-in effects of the circles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The loader adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent appearance on all devices.
- **Smooth Animation**: The animation is smooth and visually appealing, providing a professional look to your loading screens.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the size, color, and animation duration of the loader to fit your needs.

## Customization

The animated loader can be customized by modifying the CSS variables defined in the `.loadingspinner` class. Here are some options you can tweak:

- **Circle Size**: Change the size of the circles by updating the `--circle` variable.
- **Offset Distance**: Adjust the distance between circles by modifying the `--offset` variable.
- **Animation Duration**: Control the overall duration of the animation with the `--duration` variable.
- **Delay Between Animations**: Set the delay between each circle's animation using the `--delay` variable.
- **Background Color**: Change the background color of the circles by updating the `background` property in the `.loadingspinner div` selector.

Example:

```css
.loadingspinner {
    --circle: 30px;
    --offset: 35px;
    --duration: 3s;
    --delay: 0.3s;
