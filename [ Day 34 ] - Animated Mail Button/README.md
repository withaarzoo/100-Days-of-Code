# Animated Mail Button

This project is part of day 34 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

It features an animated mail button created using HTML and CSS. When you hover over the mail button, the top fold of the envelope rotates, and the letter inside expands to reveal its content. A shadow effect also adjusts to enhance the animation.

## Preview

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; width: 100%; border-radius: 0.6rem;">
    <img src="preview.gif" alt="preview GIF" width="100%" height="100%" style="overflow: none; border-radius: inherit;"/>
</div>

## Project Overview

The project consists of an HTML structure and a CSS stylesheet. The HTML sets up the structure of the animated mail button, while the CSS provides the styling and animations.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file includes:

- A container for the letter image.
- Various div elements representing different parts of the envelope and the letter.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file includes:

- General styles for the body background.
- Detailed styles and animations for the envelope and letter parts.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Centering**: The mail button is centered in the viewport using CSS transformations.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and transformations provide a smooth animation effect when the envelope is hovered over.
- **Realistic Envelope**: The envelope consists of multiple parts (back fold, top fold, left fold) to create a realistic look.
