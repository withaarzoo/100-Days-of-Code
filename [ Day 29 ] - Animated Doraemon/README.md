2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You should see an animated Doraemon character displayed on the screen.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the animated Doraemon. It includes:

- A `head` section with metadata and title.
- A `body` section containing the elements for Doraemon's head, eyes, nose, whiskers, and mouth.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides the styling for the Doraemon character. It includes:

- Background gradient for the entire body.
