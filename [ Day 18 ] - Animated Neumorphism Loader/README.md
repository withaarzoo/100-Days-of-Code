# Neumorphism Loader

This project is part of Day 18 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge, aimed at improving coding skills by committing to code daily for 100 days.

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation of a neumorphism-style loader. Neumorphism is a design trend that aims to create a soft, 3D-like appearance, often with elements that appear to be pressed into or extruded from a background surface.

## Preview

    <img src="preview.gif" alt="preview GIF" width="100%" height="100%" style="overflow: none; border-radius: inherit;"/>
</div>
