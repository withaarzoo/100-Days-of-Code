# Animated Toogle Switch

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode challenge project! In this project, I've implemented a custom checkbox toggle with associated text, utilizing HTML and CSS.

## Preview

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; width: 100%; border-radius: 0.6rem;">
    <img src="preview.gif" alt="preview GIF" width="100%" height="100%" style="overflow: none; border-radius: inherit;"/>
</div>
This preview showcases the animated tab bar in action.
