# Glassmorphism Loader

This project is part of day 39 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This repository contains HTML and CSS code for creating a visually appealing glassmorphism loader. Glassmorphism is a design trend that employs transparent or semi-transparent backgrounds with frosted glass-like effects, providing a sleek and modern appearance to user interfaces.
