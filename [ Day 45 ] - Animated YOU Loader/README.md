# Project Title: Animated Loader

This project is part of day 45 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This project demonstrates the implementation of an animated loader using HTML and CSS. The loader is designed to provide visual feedback to users while waiting for content to load or processes to complete. It utilizes SVG elements and CSS animations to create a visually appealing loading animation.
