# Animated Cat Loader

This project is part of Day 13 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge, aimed at improving coding skills by committing to code daily for 100 days.

This is a simple HTML and CSS code snippet that creates an animated cat loader. The loader features a playful animation of a cat formed by various segments. Each segment is given a distinct gradient effect, resulting in a visually appealing and engaging loader animation.

## Customization

You can customize the loader to match your project's design by adjusting the colors, sizes, and animation timings in the CSS code. Here are a few things you can customize:

- Background color: Modify the `background` property of the `.cat` class to change the background color of the loader.
- Gradient colors: Update the gradient colors used in the `.cat__segment:before` pseudo-element to create your desired color scheme.
- Animation duration: Adjust the animation duration and easing in the `@keyframes loop` to control the speed and smoothness of the loader animation.

## Compatibility
