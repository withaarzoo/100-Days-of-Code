# Animated 3D Tree

This project is part of day 37 of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

This project features a captivating tree animation inspired by the design created by NlghtM4re, showcased on [uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/profile/NlghtM4re). The animation is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and dynamic representation of a stylized tree.

## Getting Started

To view and experience the tree animation, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

```bash
open index.html
```

## Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file defines the container and the tree structure. The branches and stem are generated dynamically using JavaScript for modularity and ease of maintenance.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file contains styles for the tree animation and its components. It leverages CSS variables for flexibility and easy customization.

3. **JavaScript Scripting**: The JavaScript file dynamically generates the branches and stems of the tree. It adds each branch and stem with appropriate styles to the HTML structure.

## Features

- **Dynamic Branch Generation**: The animation includes dynamically generated branches, reducing redundancy and enhancing modularity.

- **Stylized Design**: The tree branches and stem feature a stylized design with gradients and shading for a visually appealing look.

- **Animation**: The tree undergoes a continuous animation, simulating a gentle swaying motion.

- **Responsive Layout**: The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and engaging experience across different devices.

## Credits

- **Design Inspiration**: The tree animation design is inspired by NlghtM4re's work, as seen on [uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/profile/NlghtM4re).
